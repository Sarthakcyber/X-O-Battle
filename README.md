A Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a classic beginner project that showcases the fundamentals of web development while also being surprisingly fun to create and play.
HTML (Structure):
The HTML provides the layoutâ€”a simple 3x3 grid usually made with a combination of <div> elements. Each square (or "cell") acts as a clickable area where players can place their X or O. There are also areas for a game title, player turn indicator, and possibly a reset button.
CSS (Style):
CSS is used to make the game visually appealing. The grid can be styled with borders to resemble a real Tic Tac Toe board. You can add hover effects, transitions, and animations to make interactions smooth and intuitive. Styles also help differentiate between Xs and Os using colors and fonts.
JavaScript (Logic):
JavaScript is the brain of the game. It handles:
- Tracking player turns
- Registering clicks on the grid
- Placing Xs and Os in the correct cells
- Checking for win conditions or a tie
- Resetting the game state for a new round
